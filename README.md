# Zorklike

It is a small conversational exploration game where as a novice investigator you will go to visit a house where a strange crime has been committed.

I have expanded the game a bit by putting npcs to talk to and give items. And a complex item usage system where you can unlock doors using items, change other items, light up rooms, etc.

The hardest part was making the full database, to be honest it was a bit long for the time I had.
